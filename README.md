# What is JerryScript?
JerryScript is a general purpose utility and trolling lua script made for the GTA V mod menu Stand. Primarily inspired by lanceScript and keramisScript with a goal to offer unique, useful and fun features not found in any of the menus versions as of today.

To make the script intuitive and easy to use it has been made to feel as close to the design of Stand as possible. Thus it features seamless translation when changing to any of the 10 languages in the menus settings, without the need of restarting the script. It also offers a command list, structured the same way as the one made for Stand.

A complete command list for all options found in JerryScript.


# Installation guide

There is an easy and a hard way to Install my script. The Easy way is by installing from the Lua repository inside Stand, and the hard way is to install it manually from my Github. I strongly recommend installing it from stands repo. Unless, for some reason it isn't available.


## Installing from Stands Lua repository

Press `u`

Type `search repository`

Check the toggle to download the script from stands repo.

This will also make the script automatically update whenever new updates are released.


## Installing from Github

Go to [releases](https://github.com/Jerrrry123/JerryScript/releases) and download the latest release.

Once it's downloaded, decompress the files and open the folder.

This folder is structured how the files should be located in your lua scripts directory.

Copy or move the files to their corresponding location, `JerryScript.lua` should be directly in the lua scripts, while the contents of the folders should be moved its counterpart.

Done! You should now be able to use the latest version of JerryScript.
